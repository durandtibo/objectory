# Contributing to `objectory`

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Overview

We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source.

- If you are planning to contribute back bug-fixes, please do so without any further discussion.
- If you plan to contribute new features, utility functions, or extensions to the core, please first
  open an issue and discuss the feature with us.

Once you implement and test your feature or bug-fix, please submit a Pull Request.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Git
- `uv` for dependency management (recommended) or `pip`

### Setting up your development environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/objectory.git
   cd objectory
   ```

3. Set up the development environment:
   ```shell
   make setup-venv
   ```

   This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```shell
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```shell
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes:
   ```shell
   make unit-test-cov
   ```
6. Make sure your code lints:
   ```shell
   inv check-lint
   ```
7. Format your code:
   ```shell
   inv check-format
   ```
8. Run the pre-commit hooks:
   ```shell
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
9. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused on a single issue or feature
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Reference any related issues in the PR description

## Code Style

This project follows these style guidelines:

- **Code formatting**: [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with 100 character line length
- **Linting**: [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
- **Docstrings
  **: [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings)
- **Type hints**: Required for all public APIs

Pre-commit hooks will automatically check formatting and run linters.

## Testing
