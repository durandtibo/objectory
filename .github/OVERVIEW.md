# GitHub Actions Workflows

This document provides an overview of the GitHub Actions workflows and the structure of the
`.github` folder in the `objectory` repository.

## Overview

The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, testing, documentation deployment,
and package publishing. The workflows are designed to be modular and reusable, with a custom
composite action for setting up the development environment.

## Custom Composite Action

### `setup-env`

**Location**: `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yaml`

A reusable composite action that handles the common setup steps for most workflows.

**Purpose**:

- Installs `uv` package manager
- Sets up Python environment
- Installs dependencies using invoke tasks
- Shows environment configuration and dependency tree

**Inputs**:

- `python-version`: Python version to use (default: `3.13`)
- `package-name`: Optional package name to install
- `package-version`: Optional package version to install
- `install-args`: Optional arguments when installing dependencies (e.g., `--docs-deps`,
  `--no-optional-deps`)

**Usage**:

```yaml
- name: Setup python environment
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup-env
  with:
    python-version: '3.12'
    install-args: '--docs-deps'
```

## Main Workflows

### CI Workflow (`ci.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Pushes to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Main continuous integration workflow that orchestrates all quality checks.

**Jobs**: Calls the following reusable workflows:

- `build` - Package build tests
- `coverage` - Code coverage reporting
- `cyclic-imports` - Cyclic import detection
- `doctest` - Documentation tests
- `format` - Code formatting checks
- `pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook validation
- `test` - Unit and integration tests
- `test-deps` - Dependency compatibility tests

### Build Tests (`build.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows (`workflow_call`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Validates that the package can be built and installed correctly across different distribution types and configurations.

**Jobs**:

1. **build**:
    - Uses a matrix strategy to test:
        - Distribution types: `sdist` (source distribution) and `wheel`
        - Extras: base installation (no extras) and `all` optional dependencies
    - Builds the package using `uv build`
    - Checks that `py.typed` is present in the distribution
    - Installs the built package (with or without extras)
    - Validates the build with `twine check`
    - Checks package metadata
    - Checks dependency tree
    - Verifies basic import works
    - Validates package version is not `0.0.0`
    - Verifies that `pyright` recognizes the package as typed via type checking

### Test Workflow (`test.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows (`workflow_call`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Runs comprehensive test suite across multiple Python versions and operating systems.

**Jobs**:

1. **all**:
    - Runs on multiple OS: Ubuntu (latest, 24.04, 22.04, ARM), macOS (latest, 26, 15, 14, Intel)
    - Tests Python versions: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 (including free-threaded builds)
    - Runs unit and integration tests with coverage

2. **min**:
    - Same matrix as `all` but with minimal dependencies (`--no-optional-deps`)
    - Ensures the package works without optional dependencies

### Coverage Workflow (`coverage.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows (`workflow_call`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Generates code coverage reports and uploads them to Codecov.

**Jobs**:

- Runs unit and integration tests with coverage
- Uploads coverage data to Codecov (only for the main repository)
- Failures in uploading to Codecov do not fail the workflow

### Documentation Workflows

#### Stable Documentation (`docs.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Builds and deploys documentation for stable releases.

**Jobs**:

- Sets up environment with documentation dependencies
- Configures git for the docs bot
- Publishes documentation using `mike` (documentation versioning tool)

#### Development Documentation (`docs-dev.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Pushes to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Builds and deploys documentation for the development version.

### PyPI Publishing (`pypi.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Publishes the package to PyPI.

**Jobs**:

- Installs `uv` and `invoke`
- Runs the publish command with PyPI token from secrets

### Additional Workflows

#### Nightly Tests (`nightly-tests.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Automatically updates pre-commit hook versions.

#### Format Check (`format.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Checks code formatting using Black and Ruff.

#### Cyclic Imports (`cyclic-imports.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Detects circular import dependencies.

#### Doctest (`doctest.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Runs doctests to validate code examples in documentation.

#### Test Dependencies (`test-deps.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Called by other workflows
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Tests the package with different versions of dependencies.

#### Dependency Review (`dependency-review.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- Pull requests

**Purpose**: Reviews dependency changes for security vulnerabilities.

#### Update Dependencies (`update-deps.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

**Purpose**: Creates pull requests to update dependencies.

#### Cancel Stale Queued Runs (`cancel_stale_queued_runs.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Push to any branch
- Pull requests

**Purpose**: Cancels outdated workflow runs to save CI resources.

#### Generate Package Versions (`generate-package-versions.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Generates version compatibility documentation.

#### Get Versions (`get-versions.yaml`)

**Triggers**:

- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose**: Retrieves version information from the project.

## Workflow Permissions

Most workflows use minimal permissions following the principle of least privilege:

- `contents: read` - Default for read-only operations
- `contents: write` - Only for workflows that need to push changes (e.g., documentation deployment)

## Secrets Used

The following secrets are configured in the repository settings:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For uploading coverage reports to Codecov
- `PYPI_TOKEN` - For publishing packages to PyPI
- `CI_BOT_EMAIL` - Email address for the CI bot (used for documentation deployment)

## Best Practices

1. **Reusable Workflows**: Common workflows are defined with `workflow_call` trigger so they can be
   reused by other workflows.

2. **Matrix Testing**: The test workflows use matrix strategies to test across multiple Python
   versions and operating systems.

3. **Composite Actions**: The `setup-env` action centralizes common setup steps, reducing
   duplication.

4. **Timeouts**: All jobs have reasonable timeout limits (typically 10 minutes) to prevent hung
   workflows.

5. **Fail-Fast**: Most matrix jobs use `fail-fast: false` to continue testing other combinations
   even if one fails.

6. **Version Pinning**: GitHub Actions are pinned to specific major versions (e.g., `@v6`, `@v7`)
   for stability.

7. **Minimal Changes**: Workflows are designed to make minimal assumptions about the environment and
   clean up after themselves.

## Dependabot Configuration

The repository uses Dependabot to automatically update GitHub Actions dependencies. The
configuration is in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

The repository provides templates to help contributors submit well-structured issues and pull
requests:

- **Bug Report**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`
