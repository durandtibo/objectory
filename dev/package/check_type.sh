# check_type.sh - Validate package type annotations
#
# Description:
#   Verifies that the package is properly typed by running pyright on a test
#   import. Creates a temporary test file that imports the package and checks
#   that pyright recognizes it as typed. Ensures the package includes py.typed
#   marker and proper type stubs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./check_type.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - pyright must be installed and available in PATH
#   - objectory package must be installed in the current environment
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - Package is properly typed and pyright validation passed
#   1 - Package type checking failed or pyright detected errors
