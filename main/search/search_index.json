Every time that you create a new child class of the base factory class, the child class is automatically registered to the factory. For example, you can define the <code>Child1Class</code> class with the following implementation:</p> <pre><code>from objectory import AbstractFactory\n\n\nclass BaseClass(metaclass=AbstractFactory):\n    pass\n\n\nclass Child1Class(BaseClass):\n    pass\n</code></pre> <p>When the <code>Child1Class</code> class is created, it is automatically added to the <code>BaseClass</code> factory. The developer does not have to write any additional line to register the class. It is possible to define more complex child classes with a constructor or any functions/attributes. For example, you can define the <code>Child2Class</code> class with the following implementation:</p> <pre><code>class Child2Class(BaseClass):\n    def __init__(self, dim: int):\n        self.dim = dim\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, any grand child class of the base factory class is automatically registered to the factory.

However, it is not possible to do that in particular when the code depends on a third party library. To overcome this limitation, it is possible to use the <code>register_object</code> function to manually register some classes that are defined outside the project.</p> <p>Let's take the example of PyTorch. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework. To define a machine learning model in PyTorch, you can implement a new class that inherits from the <code>torch.nn.Module</code> class. PyTorch also provides many module implementations. If you want to build a factory that includes both your module implementations and the PyTorch ones, you can do it by using the inheritance and the <code>register_object</code> function. First, you need to define the base factory class:</p> <pre><code>import torch\nfrom objectory import AbstractFactory\n\n\nclass BaseModule(torch.nn.Module, metaclass=AbstractFactory):\n    pass\n\n\nclass MyModule1(BaseModule):\n    pass\n\n\nclass MyModule2(BaseModule):\n    pass\n</code></pre> <p>Then you can register some modules implemented in PyTorch. For example if you want to register the class <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> to the factory of <code>BaseModule</code>, you can write the following lines:</p> <pre><code>import torch\n\nBaseModule.register_object(torch.nn.Linear)\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>register_object</code> function can be used to register a class but also a function. To be consistent with the factory idea, you should only register functions that returns an object that is compatible with the common interface of the factory. Note that no warning will be raised if you do not follow this rule, but it will be your responsibility to manage this situation. Please keep in mind that with power comes responsibility. The following example shows how to register a function:</p> <pre><code>import torch\n\n\ndef my_nodule(input_size: int, output_size: int) -&gt; torch.nn.Module:\n    return torch.nn.Sequential(\n        torch.nn.Linear(input_size, 32),\n        torch.nn.ReLU(),\n        torch.nn.Linear(32, output_size),\n    )\n\n\nBaseModule.register_object(my_nodule)\n</code></pre> <p>Another approach to register a function is to use the decorator <code>register</code>:</p> <pre><code>import torch\nfrom objectory import register\n\n\n@register(BaseModule)\ndef my_nodule(input_size: int, output_size: int) -&gt; torch.nn.Module:\n    return torch.nn.Sequential(\n        torch.nn.Linear(input_size, 32),\n        torch.nn.ReLU(),\n        torch.nn.Linear(32, output_size),\n    )\n</code></pre> <p>The argument of the decorator is the base factory class where the function will be registered.</p> <p> It is not possible to register a lambda function.

To instantiate dynamically an object with an object factory, you need to specify the name of the object. Then, the object factory will look at its internal registry to find where is the object associated to the name that you gave. A problem happens when there are several ways to instantiate an object.</p> <p>Let's take the example of PyTorch \u2013note that the motivation is not specific to PyTorch and you can find similar situations in other libraries. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. In particular, let's look at the <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> class. According to the documentation, you can use this class in your code by writing something like:</p> <pre><code>from torch.nn import Linear\n</code></pre> <p>It will work but if you print the class <code>Linear</code>, you will see that the real path to it is not <code>torch.nn.Linear</code>.

Which one should you use? </p> <p>Choosing one approach is probably not a good idea because it will force all the users to use the same approach which can be challenging in practice. A solution is to use a name resolution mechanism which will allow using several approaches to instantiate an object. By default, the <code>objectory</code> library uses the real full name to register an object. Each object is registered with its real full name, so in the PyTorch example, the class <code>Linear</code> is registered with the name <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code>.</p> <p>The factory should understand that you can use <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code> or <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> to instantiate the class <code>Linear</code>. If you give <code>torch.nn.Linear</code>, the name resolution mechanism should transform it in <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code>.</p> <p>For the PyTorch library, the development team recommend to use <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> instead of <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code> because it will make your code more robust to some changes in the package <code>torch.nn</code>. The name resolution mechanism will allow you to do that because you do not have to give the real full name of the object. Internally, the factory uses <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code> and it connects the name <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> to <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code> so specifying <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> is equivalent to write <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code>.</p> <p>Another advantage of the name resolution mechanism is that you can specify only the object (class or function) name. Writing the full name of each object can be time-consuming. The advantage of writing the full name is that there is no ambiguity of the object that you want to instantiate if there are several objects with the same name. However, it is possible to use the information about the registered objects in the factory to find the object to use. For example if you want to instantiate an object of class <code>X</code>, you can look at how many objects with name <code>X</code> are registered in the factory. The name resolution mechanism will work if there is a single match i.e. there is a single registered object with the name <code>X</code>. It will not work if there are several matches because the factory does not know which object to choose. In that case you will have to use the full name of the object to break the ambiguity.</p> <p>If we continue with the previous example, you can use the query <code>Linear</code> to instantiate the class if there is no other object with that name in the factory. The name resolution mechanism will explore the names registered in the factory and will find it matches with <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code>. It will associate <code>Linear</code> to <code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear</code>.</p>"},{"location":"name_resolution/#how-to-use-name-resolution-mechanism","title":"How to use name resolution mechanism","text":"<p>It is quite easy to use the name resolution mechanism, and it can be used outside the object factories. The first input is the query name, and the second input is the set of possible object names. In the object factory implementations, it is the set of registered object names. For the following example, let's assume the set of possible object names is: <code>{'torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear', 'my_package.MyClass'}</code>. The name resolution mechanism will try to find the query name in the set of possible object names. Let's assume that the query name is <code>'Linear'</code>. To use the name resolution mechanism, you can write the following code:</p> <pre><code>from objectory.utils import resolve_name\n\nprint(resolve_name(\"Linear\", {\"torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear\", \"my_package.MyClass\"}))\n</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code>torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the resolved name is <code>'torch.nn.modules.linear.Linear'</code> because there is a single object with the name <code>Linear</code> in the set.

If the query name is not a valid python identifier, the matching mechanism returns an empty set.
